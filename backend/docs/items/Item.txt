ITEM TEMPLATE vs INSTANCE SYSTEM

TEMPLATES (What CAN exist):
- Weapon, Helmet, Armor, Boots, Shield, Spell, Consumable
- These are generated by AI during campaign creation
- Define the "blueprint" of what items can exist
- No inventory_id - they exist independently
- Can be referenced by shops, quests, NPCs
- Multiple players can reference the same template

INSTANCES (What DOES exist):
- WeaponInstance, HelmetInstance, ArmorInstance, etc.
- Created when a player acquires an item from a template
- Each instance is unique and owned by one player
- Has inventory_id pointing to owner's inventory
- Has template_id pointing to the original template
- When used/consumed, the instance is deleted but template remains

AI GENERATION LOGIC:
1. AI generates templates during campaign creation
2. Templates define available items for shops, quests, loot drops
3. When player buys/finds item, create instance from template
4. Instance inherits all properties from template
5. Instance can be equipped, used, traded, etc.
6. When instance is consumed, it's deleted but template remains for others

BENEFITS:
- Items can be shared between players (same template)
- Shops can sell unlimited quantities
- Items can respawn/restock
- Clear separation between "what exists" vs "what can exist"
