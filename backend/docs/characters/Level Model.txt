Level fields (now part of Stats @Embeddable)

Note: Level functionality has been consolidated into the Stats class for better cohesion.

Fields now in Stats:
- level (int) - Current character level
- currentExp (int) - Current experience points
- expForNextLevel (int) - Experience required for next level

This consolidation provides:
- Single source of truth for character attributes
- Better cohesion between level and stat calculations
- Simpler queries and data management
