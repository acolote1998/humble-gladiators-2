Turn (@Entity)

Long id
@ManyToOne Battle battle // Battle this turn belongs to
@ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY) Campaign campaign // Campaign this turn belongs to
@ManyToOne CharacterInstance performingCharacter // Character performing the action
@ManyToOne CharacterInstance targetCharacter // Character receiving the action
@Embedded Action action // Action details (damage, healing, type, state effects)
@CreationTimestamp LocalDateTime createdAt // Auto-managed by JPA
@UpdateTimestamp LocalDateTime updatedAt // Auto-managed by JPA

JPA Configuration:
- Uses Lombok @Getter and @Setter annotations
- Campaign relationship uses lazy fetching for performance

Note:
- Action is embedded rather than referenced for better performance
- Turn represents a single action within a battle
- Can reconstruct battle by executing turns in chronological order
- Campaign relationship allows for campaign-level turn tracking
